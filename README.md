## ðŸš€ Node.js Mastery â€“ Arun's Deep Dive Repository 

Welcome to my personal Node.js mastery journey!

This repository documents everything Iâ€™m learning, exploring, and understanding from the internals of Node.js, inspired by Akshay Sainiâ€™s Namaste Node.js and real-world backend systems.

### ðŸ“š Topics Covered
ðŸ”¹ - ðŸ”¹ [**Optional Chaining (`?.`)**](./dive_deep/optional_chaining.md)
â†’ Understanding how it safely accesses deep properties and replaces nested if checks.

ðŸ”¹ "use strict" â€“ Why it's used everywhere (coming soon)
â†’ Explains strict mode benefits, performance, and why Node uses it in every file.

ðŸ”¹ hideStackFrames() â€“ Clean Error Traces (coming soon)
â†’ Learn how Node hides internal logic from stack traces using this utility.

ðŸ”¹ require vs import â€“ Node Module System (planned)
â†’ Deep dive into CommonJS vs ESModules and how Node.js handles both.

ðŸ”¹ Node.js Architecture Overview (planned)
â†’ Breakdown of Node.js core components, threadpool, libuv, event loop, and more.

ðŸ“Œ Goal
Build clarity, confidence, and mastery in Node.js by understanding the "why behind the how".

This repo is not for syntax memorization â€” itâ€™s for real-world backend engineering depth.
